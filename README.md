# Taikyoku Shogi Engine

A complete engine for **Taikyoku Shogi** (大局将棋, "ultimate chess"), the largest known variant of shogi.

- **36 x 36** board (1,296 squares)
- **804 pieces** (402 per side)
- **209 initial piece types** with distinct movement patterns
- **92 additional promoted forms** (301 movement classes in total)

## Rules Overview

### Objective

Capture all of your opponent's **royal pieces** (King and Crown Prince). The game ends immediately when a player's last royal piece is captured. Unlike standard shogi, there is no check or checkmate — you may move your King into danger.

### Turns

Black (先手) moves first. Players alternate moving exactly one piece per turn. Passing is not allowed. Captured pieces are permanently removed (no drops).

### Movement

Pieces move orthogonally or diagonally. Most pieces have unique movement patterns combining:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step** | Move exactly 1 square |
| **Slide** | Move any number of empty squares in a line |
| **Limited** | Move up to N squares in a line (2-7) |
| **Jump** | Leap to a square, bypassing intervening pieces |
| **Hook** | Slide along a line, optionally turn 90 degrees once, then continue sliding |
| **Area** | Take multiple steps per turn (Lion-type moves) |
| **Range capture** | Fly over pieces along a line, capturing all of lower rank |

See [PIECES.md](PIECES.md) for the complete movement reference for every piece.

### Promotion

The **promotion zone** is the 11 rows on the opponent's side of the board.

- A piece **may promote** when it moves into the promotion zone from outside, or when it captures an opponent's piece while inside the zone.
- A piece that entered the zone without promoting may only promote later by capturing inside the zone, or by leaving and re-entering.
- Promotion is **optional**, except for forward-only pieces (Pawn, Stone General, Iron General, Dog, Wood General, Incense Chariot, Ox Chariot, Fierce Tiger) which **must promote** upon reaching the farthest rank.
- Promotion is permanent — a piece cannot revert to its unpromoted form.

### Range Capture Ranking

Range-capturing pieces (Great General, Vice General, etc.) can fly over and capture all pieces along a line, but only pieces of **lower rank**:

1. King, Crown Prince — cannot be range-captured
2. Great General
3. Vice General
4. Flying General, Angle General, Fierce Dragon, Flying Crocodile

### Draw by No Progress (500-Move Rule)

The game is automatically drawn if **500 consecutive full moves** (1,000 plies) pass with neither player making a capture nor a promotion. This prevents games from continuing indefinitely when neither side can make progress. The counter resets whenever a piece is captured or a promotion occurs.

### Initial Setup

Each side's 402 pieces occupy 12 ranks. Black occupies the bottom of the board (rows 25-36); White mirrors from the top (rows 1-12). The King sits at the center of the back rank, flanked by the Crown Prince.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A recent stable **Rust toolchain** (the crate targets Rust edition 2021).
- **Node.js + npm** only if you want to rebuild the `web/` frontend
  (TypeScript + Vite; a prebuilt `dist/` is committed).
- **Python 3.9+** only for the NNUE training pipeline in `training/` (see
  [training/README.md](training/README.md)).

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/El-Gabo-45/taikyokushogiTei.git
cd taikyokushogi

# Build the engine, server, CLI tools and examples in release mode
cargo build --release
```

### Web GUI

```bash
# Rebuild the frontend (only needed after editing web/src)
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Start the HTTP server: REST API + static web frontend
cargo run --release --bin taikyokushogi-server
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Web GUI Features

- **Game modes**: Human vs Random, Human vs AI, Random vs Random, AI vs AI
- Play as **Black or White**; pick the AI strength (Random, D1, D2, D3)
- Click a piece to see its legal moves highlighted on the board
  (green = move, red = capture)
- Hover and last-move highlights, board coordinates, kanji piece glyphs
- Sidebar shows the side to move, move number, piece counts, material
  score, status and the full move log
- **New Game** / **Undo** buttons and an **Auto** play toggle

### REST API

The server exposes a small JSON REST API — `/api/state`, `/api/moves`,
`/api/piece-info/{abbrev}`, `/api/new-game`, `/api/move`, `/api/ai-move`,
`/api/undo` — consumed by the frontend in `web/src/api/client.ts`.
See `src/main.rs` for the route handlers.

### Command-Line Tools

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `taikyokushogi-server` | HTTP server + web GUI (REST API in `src/main.rs`) |
| `debug-cli` | CLI search harness: best move, score, nodes, time |
| `selfplay` | Self-play training-data generator for the NNUE pipeline |

```bash
# Search the initial position at depth 5 with a 10 s time limit
cargo run --release --bin debug-cli 5 10000

# Generate 100 self-play games (depth 3, 4 workers, 200 ms per move)
cargo run --release --bin selfplay 100 3 0 4 200
# -> writes training_data/samples_*.bin and training_data/games.db
```

### Examples and Benchmarks

All examples run with `cargo run --release --example <name>`:

| Example | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bench_fixed` | Deterministic fixed-depth search benchmark (depths as args) |
| `bench_nps` | NPS + component timing (movegen, eval, apply/undo) + bottleneck analysis |
| `check_movecounts` | Legal move count from the initial position |
| `stress_undo` | Apply/undo stress test (checks the board state round-trips) |
| `bench`, `bench_deep`, `bench_depth1`, `bench_midgame`, `bench_thorough`, `bench_time` | Additional benchmarks |
| `export_piece_metadata` | Writes `training/piece_metadata.json` for the NNUE pipeline |
| `toggle_nnue` | Runtime NNUE on/off smoke test |
| `play` | Minimal command-line game loop |
| `check_db` | Self-play SQLite database sanity checks |

```bash
cargo run --release --example bench_fixed 4 5 6   # fixed-depth search at depths 4, 5, 6
cargo run --release --example check_movecounts    # -> 512 legal moves
cargo run --release --example bench_nps           # full benchmark report
```

## Performance

Measured on the development machine with the release-mode benchmarks
(`cargo run --release --example bench_nps` and `--example bench_fixed`). The CPU I used is a Xeon E3 1230 V2

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Legal moves from the initial position | 512 |
| Move generation (`legal_moves`) | ~70 µs |
| Static evaluation (`evaluate`) | ~50 µs |
| `apply` + `undo` round trip | ~55 µs |
| Perft(2) | 260,908 nodes @ ~20 M nodes/s |
| Search — depth 1 | ~13 ms |
| Search — depth 2 | ~190 ms |
| Search — depth 3 | ~160 ms |
| Search — depth 4 | ~2.7 s (~450 k nodes/s) |

Every depth runs a real alpha-beta search (an old depth≤3 material-delta
shortcut that made shallow depths equivalent to depth 1 is now disabled by
default — see `search::params::MATERIAL_FAST_PATH_MAX_DEPTH`).

The search (`src/search/`) uses iterative deepening with aspiration
windows, principal-variation search (PVS), a transposition table with
lock-free concurrent access, killer / counter / history move ordering,
null-move pruning, razoring / reverse-futility / futility / ProbCut
pruning, staged move generation and quiescence search. At depth ≥ 4,
Lazy SMP parallelism spawns up to 3 helper threads.

### Strength testing

```bash
cargo run --release --example match_race -- 20 3 2 5000 4   # depth 3 vs depth 2, 20 games
```

Head-to-head matches between any two search configurations (depths, time
budgets, handcrafted vs NNUE via the eval toggle) with alternating colors
and deterministic opening randomization. For publishable Elo claims, run
>= 1000 games and compute a confidence interval or SPRT bounds on the
W/L/D counts.

## Neural Evaluation (NNUE)

An experimental neural-network evaluator (`src/eval/nnue.rs`,
HalfKP-style features) can be enabled at runtime with
`taikyokushogi::set_use_nnue(true)`; the weights are loaded from the path
in the `TAIKYOKU_NNUE_PATH` environment variable. Run the `toggle_nnue`
example for a smoke test.

The accumulator is now maintained **incrementally** by `Board::apply_move`
(O(FT_NEURONS) deltas per moved/captured piece, full refresh only when a
royal anchor changes) and restored in O(1) on undo, so per-evaluate cost no
longer includes the O(pieces × FT_NEURONS) rebuild. The remaining per-call
cost is the network forward pass itself (~3 ms with the current dense
layers — fine for validation and training pipelines; faster inference needs
the flattened-weight redesign planned for the next architecture).

The full PyTorch training pipeline — generating data with `selfplay`,
feature extraction, training, and exporting `.nnue` files — lives in
[training/](training/README.md).

## Using as a Rust Crate

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
taikyokushogi = "0.1"
```

```rust
use taikyokushogi::{Board, Color};

let mut board = Board::initial();
let moves = board.legal_moves();
println!("{} legal moves", moves.len()); // 512

board.apply(&moves[0]);
println!("Score: {}", board.material_score());
board.undo();

// Search: depth + time limit in ms (0 = no limit)
let result = board.search(2, 5000);
if let Some(mv) = result.best_move {
    println!("Best: {}, score: {}", mv, result.score);
}

// TSFEN notation (the "FEN" of Taikyoku Shogi)
let fen = board.to_tsfen();
let restored = Board::from_tsfen(fen).unwrap();

// Piece metadata
let info = taikyokushogi::piece_info("LN").unwrap();
println!("{}: value={} area={} igui={}",
         info.name, info.value, info.area_steps, info.has_igui);

// Switch between the hand-crafted and the NNUE evaluator
// (requires a trained .nnue file — see training/README.md)
// taikyokushogi::set_use_nnue(true);
```

## Cargo Features

- `cpu` (default) — pure-CPU engine
- `gpu-cuda`, `gpu-metal`, `gpu-wgpu`, `gpu-vulkan` — GPU evaluation via `burn`
- `nnue` — enables the NNUE evaluator (`burn` + `ndarray`)
