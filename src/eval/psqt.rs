//! Precomputed Piece-Square Table (PSQT) evaluation.
//!
//! The PSQT combines material value, family weight, and zone bonus into a
//! single precomputed table indexed by (piece_type, square, color). This
//! makes `evaluate()` a simple O(pieces) sum over the piece list — and with
//! incremental updates on the board, O(1) per call.
//!
//! Reference: "Piece-Square Tables" — Chess Programming Wiki. Stockfish
//! maintains incremental PSQT scores this way.
